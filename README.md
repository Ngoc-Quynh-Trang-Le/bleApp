# üì± BLE-to-Web Cultural Storytelling App  

**Da Nang Museum of Cham Sculpture**  
COS10025 ‚Äì Smart Environments Project

---

## ‚úÖ App Overview

This mobile app helps museum visitors experience the stories of Cham artifacts in a respectful, hands-free way. As a visitor walks near an artifact, the app quietly listens for a small BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) signal coming from an ESP32 beacon hidden near the display.

When the app detects **only one artifact** is nearby, the app **automatically opens a webpage** that tells the story of that artifact, using the phone‚Äôs normal browser. This means the visitor doesn‚Äôt have to tap, pair, scan anything, or interact with their phone ‚Äî it just works automatically.

If the visitor happens to be standing in the overlapping proximity of **more than one artifact**, the app will gently show a **clean, one-tap list of artifact names** on the screen for the visitor to choose which story they‚Äôd like to explore.

This system was designed to be:

* üëê **Hands-free and easy** ‚Äì no setup or Bluetooth pairing needed
* üßç‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Respectful** ‚Äì works silently without disturbing sacred spaces
* üåê **Accessible to everyone** ‚Äì tourists, students, and elders can use it easily
* üõ°Ô∏è **Culturally appropriate** ‚Äì lets visitors explore stories quietly and at their own pace, without distractions

Visitors don‚Äôt need to install anything extra or understand technology. They simply carry their phone as they explore ‚Äî the app takes care of the rest.

## üì¶ Dependencies

The app uses native BLE libraries and must be built with **React Native CLI** (not Expo Go).

### Required Packages

```bash
npm install react-native react-native-cli
npm install react-native-ble-plx react-native-permissions
npx pod-install  # For iOS
```

### Optional (UI Framework, if used)

```bash
npm install react-native-paper
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ngoc-Quynh-Trang-Le/bleApp.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd COS10025_BLEtoWebSystem/bleToWebApp
npm install
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running on Android (USB)

### 1. Connect Your Android Phone

- Enable **Developer Options** + **USB Debugging** by tapping Build Number 7 times
- Connect your phone via USB cable
- Run: `adb devices` to verify connection

### 2. Start the App

```bash
cd COS10025_BLEtoWebSystem/bleToWebApp
npx react-native run-android
```

### 3. Installing the APK

After building the app, you can install the APK on your Android device using the following command:

```bash
cd bleApp/bleToWebApp/android
./gradlew assembleRelease  # Build the release APK
adb install -r android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

### 4. Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while running the app, consider the following steps:

1. **Check Dependencies**: Ensure all required packages are installed and up-to-date.
2. **Clear Cache**: Sometimes, clearing the cache can resolve unexpected behavior:
   ```bash
   cd COS10025_BLEtoWebSystem/bleToWebApp
   npx react-native start --reset-cache
   ```
3. **Rebuild the App**: If you make changes to native code or dependencies, you may need to clean and rebuild the app:
   ```bash
   cd COS10025_BLEtoWebSystem/bleToWebApp
   cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..
   npx react-native run-android
   ```
4. **AndroidManifest.xml Issues**: If you get manifest parsing errors, run with verbose logging:
   ```bash
   npx react-native run-android --verbose
   # Or check the specific manifest processing:
   cd android && ./gradlew app:processDebugMainManifest --stacktrace --info
   ```
5. **BLE Permissions**: Ensure your AndroidManifest.xml includes all required BLE permissions for scanning and location access.

## üß≠ Usage Flow

ESP32 BLE Beacons ‚Üí Broadcast non-connectable name (e.g., Tara_Bodhisattva_Statue)

‚Üì Passive scan

React Native App:
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Scan for nearby advertisements
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Match against beacon-to-URL dictionary
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ If 1 match: Auto-open URL after 2s delay via `urlLauncher.ts`
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ If >1 match: Show a clean, one-tap list of artifact names using `BeaconList` to let user choose

‚Üí Launch correct webpage in mobile browser after 30s cooldown period to prevent spam reopening

## üåê Artifact Content Hosting

All Cham cultural artifact webpages must be:

- Hosted online via `https://` (no localhost or internal IP)
- Optimized for mobile display (HTML/CSS/JS only)
- Accessible via the university‚Äôs Mercury server
  Example:

  ```markdown
  Artifact: Tra Kieu Apsara Relief
  https://mercury.swin.edu.au/cos10025/project-groupX/TraKieu_Apsara_Relief.html
  ```

Update the mapping dictionary in `beaconMap.ts`:

```ts
export const beaconToUrl: Record<string, string> = {
  "TraKieu_Apsara_Relief": "https://mercury.swin.edu.au/.../TraKieu_Apsara_Relief.html",
  "Tara_Bodhisattva_Statue": "https://mercury.swin.edu.au/.../Tara_Bodhisattva_Statue.html"
};
```

## Configure the App Display Name
To change the app name:

update the `app.json` file in the root directory of your project to include the new app name:

```json
{
  "name": "ChamJourney",
  "displayName": "Cham Journey"
}
```

Update the `package.json` file in the root directory of your project to include the new app name:

```json
{
  "name": "cham-journey",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "A BLE-to-Web cultural storytelling app for Da Nang Museum of Cham Sculpture"
}
```

### For Android:
- Edit the `android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` file. Here's an example of how to set the app name:

```xml
<resources>
    <string name="app_name">Cham Journey</string>
</resources>
```

- Then, update the `android/app/src/main/java/com/chamjourney/MainActivity.kt` file to reflect the new app name:

```kotlin
package com.chamjourney

import com.facebook.react.ReactActivity

class MainActivity: ReactActivity() {
    override fun getMainComponentName(): String? {
        return "Cham Journey"
    }
}
```

- Finally, update the `android/app/src/main/res/values/local.properties` file to include the new app name:

```properties
app.name=Cham Journey
```

### For iOS:
- Edit the `ios/ChamJourney/Info.plist` file. Here's an example of how to set the app name:

```xml
<key>CFBundleName</key>
<string>Cham Journey</string>
```
- Update the `ios/ChamJourney/AppDelegate.m` file to reflect the new app name:

```objc
#import "AppDelegate.h"
#import <React/RCTBundleURLProvider.h>
#import <React/RCTRootView.h>

@implementation AppDelegate

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
  RCTRootView *rootView = [[RCTRootView alloc] initWithBundleURL:[[RCTBundleURLProvider sharedSettings] jsBundleURLForFallbackResource:@"index" withExtension:@"jsbundle"]
                                                    initialProperties:nil
                                                        launchOptions:launchOptions];
  rootView.backgroundColor = [UIColor whiteColor];
  self.window = [[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame:[UIScreen mainScreen].bounds];
  UIViewController *rootViewController = [[UIViewController alloc] init];
  rootViewController.view = rootView;
  self.window.rootViewController = rootViewController;
  [self.window makeKeyAndVisible];
  return YES;
}

@end
```

- After making these changes, rebuild the app to apply the new name.
